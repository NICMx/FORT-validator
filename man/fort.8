.SH DESCRIPTION

Fort is an RPKI "Relying Party" (RP), an artifact that validates Route
Origin Attestations (ROAs) by way of a Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI). ROAs are employed by routers, to verify BGP routing
attestations.
.P
Its main input is one or more Trust Anchor Locator (TAL) files
(\fI--tal\fR), which point to the RPKI Trust Anchors (ie. root certificates).
Fort downloads all the resources governed by the trust anchors into a local
cache (\fI--local-repository\fR), and proceeds to validate their entirety. The
output of the validation is a set of VRPs (Validated ROA Payloads), which are
served to
routers (\fI--mode=server\fR, \fI--server.address\fR, \fI--server.port\fR)
through the RTR protocol (RFC 6810).

.RE

.BR \-f ", " \-\-configuration-file=\fIFILE\fR
.RS 4
Path to a JSON file from where additional configuration will be read.
.P
The configuration options are mostly the same as the ones presented in this
manual. Each property is mapped as a member of the main JSON object, the
members that contain a dot '.' must be set as objects (eg.
"--server.port=8323" will be set as "{ "server": { "port": "8323" } }".
.P
An example configuration file can be seen in this manual at the \fBEXAMPLES\fR
section.
.P
Some configuration options can't be set at the JSON configuration file:
\fB--version\fR, \fB--help\fR, \fB--version\fR, and \fB--configuration-file\fR.
.P
Other configuration options can be configured exclusively at the JSON
configuration file:
.P

.B rsync.program
.RS 4
Name of the program needed to invoke an rsync file transfer. The default value
is "rsync".
.RE
.P

.B rsync.arguments-recursive
.RS 4
Arguments needed by
.B rsync.program
to perform a recursive rsync. The arguments are specified as a JSON string
array; its default value is:
[ "-rtz", "--delete", "--omit-dir-times", "--contimeout=20", "--max-size=20MB",
"--timeout=15", "--include=*/", "--include=*.cer", "--include=*.crl",
"--include=*.gbr", "--include=*.mft", "--include=*.roa", "--exclude=*",
"$REMOTE", "$LOCAL" ]
.P
FORT will replace "$REMOTE" with the remote URL it needs to download, and
"$LOCAL" with the target local directory where the file is supposed to be
dropped.
.P
See \fIrsync(1)\fR for a description of each argument.
.RE
.P

.B incidences
.RS 4
A listing of actions to be performed by validation upon encountering certain
common error conditions. This configuration is a means to modify FORTs
validator behavior upon encountering profile violations that, from experience,
are often overlooked.
.P
The incidences are configured inside the member "incidences" as a JSON array
of objects, each with two members "name" and "action", eg:
.P
"incidences": [
.RS 2
{
.RS 2
"name": "incid-hashalg-has-params",
.br
"action": "warn"
.RE
},
{
.RS 2
"name": "incid-obj-not-der-encoded",
.br
"action": "error"
.RE
}
.RE
]
.P
An incidence contains a \fBname\fR and an \fBaction\fR. The \fBname\fR is
merely an identifier defined by FORT that states a particular error condition,
and the \fBaction\fR is an enumeration that states the outcome of a violation
of the corresponding incidence.
.P
The \fBaction\fR can have one of three values:
.br
.RS 4
\fIerror\fR: Print error message in error log level, fail validation of the
offending object (and all of its children).
.br
\fIwarn\fR: Print error message in warning log level, continue validation as if
nothing happened.
.br
\fIignore\fR: Do not print error message, continue validation as if nothing
happened.
.RE
.P
Currently these are the registered incidences, each with a distinct
\fBaction\fR configured by default.
.RS 4
.br
\fIincid-hashalg-has-params\fR (Signed Object's hash algorithm has NULL object
as parameters). [Default action: \fBignore\fR]
.br
\fIincid-obj-not-der-encoded\fR (Object isn't DER encoded). [Default action:
\fBignore\fR]
.br
\fIincid-file-at-mft-not-found\fR (File listed at manifest doesn't exist).
[Default action: \fBerror\fR]
.br
\fIincid-file-at-mft-hash-not-match\fR (File hash listed at manifest doesn't
match the actual file hash). [Default action: \fBerror\fR]
.br
\fIincid-mft-stale\fR (Manifest is stale).
[Default action: \fBerror\fR]
.br
\fIincid-crl-stale\fR (CRL is stale).
[Default action: \fBerror\fR]

.BR \-t ", " \-\-tal=(\fIFILE\fR|\fIDIRECTORY\fR)
.RS 4
Path to a .tal, or a directory containing .tal files. Fort will validate the trees pointed by them.
.P
The TAL ("Trust Anchor Locator") is a text file that lists a few URLs which can be used to access the "Trust Anchor" (the root of a particular RPKI tree) and
its public key. (See RFC 8630.)
.RE
.P

.BR \-r ", " \-\-local-repository=\fIDIRECTORY\fR
.RS 4
Path to a directory where the local cache of the repository will be stored
and/or read.
.P
FORT accesses RPKI repositories either with \fIrsync\fR or \fIRRDP\fR (see RFC
8182). During each validation cycle, and depending on the preferred access
methods defined by the CAs, Fort can do two things:
.RS 4
.br
- Literally invoke an rsync command (see \fBrsync.program\fR and
\fBrsync.arguments-recursive\fR), which will download the files into
\fB--local-repository\fR.
.br
- Fetch the RRDP Update Notification file (which implies an HTTP request) and
fetch the files from there on (can be obtained from a Snapshot file or Delta
files). The files will be downloaed into \fB--local-repository\fR.
.RE
.P
Fort's entire validation process operates on the resulting copy of the files
(doesn't matter if the files where fetched by rsync of https).
.P
Because rsync uses delta encoding, you’re advised to keep this cache around. It
significantly speeds up subsequent validation cycles.
.P
By default, the path is \fI/tmp/fort/repository\fR.
.RE
.P

.B \-\-daemon
.RS 4
If this flag is activated, Fort will run as a daemon. The process is detached
from the calling terminal and sent to the background.
.P
All the enabled logs will be sent to syslog, so the configured values of
\fB--log.output\fR and \fB--validation-log.output\fR will be ignored.
.RE
.P

.B \-\-work-offline
.RS 4
If this flag is activated, Fort will disable all outgoing requests (currently
done with: \fIrsync\fR and \fIhttps\fR (RRDP protocol uses HTTPS to fetch
data)). All repository files (certificates, ROAs, etc.) are expected to exist
at configured \fB--local-repository\fR.
.P
Otherwise, Fort will perform outgoing requests whenever this is needed. If a
specific protocol needs to be deactivated, use \fB--rsync.enabled\fR or
\fB--http.enabled\fR.
.RE
.P

.B \-\-maximum-certificate-depth=\fIUNSIGNED_INTEGER\fR
.RS 4
Maximum allowable certificate chain length. Meant to protect FORT from
iterating infinitely due to certificate chain loops.
.P
By default, it has a value of \fI32\fR. The minimum allowed value is 5.
.P
(Required to prevent loops and "other degenerate forms of the logical RPKI
hierarchy." (RFC 6481))
.RE
.P

.B \-\-slurm=(\fIFILE\fR|\fIDIRECTORY\fR)
.RS 4
Path to the SLURM FILE or SLURMs DIRECTORY.
.P
The SLURM definition is from RFC 8416. SLURM stands for "Simplified Local
Internet Number Resource Management with the RPKI", basically is a document
that can override (either as a filter or adding assertions) the global RPKI
repository data fetched by FORT; potentially useful for network operators.
.P
In case a DIRECTORY is set, the files with extension '\fI.slurm\fR' will be the
ones considered as SLURM files and FORT will use them.
.P
The configured SLURM path (either \fIFILE\fR or \fIDIRECTORY\fR) will be read
each time a new validation cycle begins. If there's a syntax or content error,
the last valid version of the SLURM will be applied (if there's one) and a
message will be logged to indicate this action. Note that all this will happen
only if \fI--mode=server\fR and \fI--slurm\fR is configured.
.P
A basic example of a SLURM file can be seen in this manual at the
\fBEXAMPLES\fR section (it's almost the same as the one in RFC 8416).
.P
See more about SLURM configuration at FORT's web docs.

.B \-\-server.address=\fINODE(S)\fR
.RS 4
List of hostnames or numeric host addresses the RTR server will be bound to. Must resolve to (or be) bindable IP addresses. IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.
.P
The address list must be comma-separated, and each address must have the following format: \fB<address>[#<port>]\fR. The port defaults to \fI--server.port\fR.
.P
Here are some examples:
.br
- \fI--server.address="localhost"\fR: Bind to localhost, port \fI--server.port\fR.
.br
- \fI--server.address="localhost, ::1#8324"\fR: Same as above, and also bind to \fI[::1]:8324\fR.
.br
- \fI--server.address="localhost#8323, ::1#8324"\fR: Bind to \fIlocalhost\fR on port 8323, and to \fI[::1]:8324\fR. (\fI--server.port\fR is ignored.)
.P
Use wildcards to bind to all available addresses. Note that, for historical reasons, Linux is a bit strange:
.P
BSDs:
.P
- \fI0.0.0.0\fR : Bind to all available IPv4 addresses
.br
- \fI::\fR : Bind to all available IPv6 addresses
.br
- \fI0.0.0.0, ::\fR : Bind to all available IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
.P
Linux:
.P
- \fI0.0.0.0\fR : Bind to all available IPv4 addresses
.br
- \fI::\fR : Bind to all available IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
.br
- \fI0.0.0.0, ::\fR : Error
.RE
.P

.B \-\-server.port=\fISERVICE\fR
.RS 4
TCP port or service the server address(es) will be bound to by default if no
port is set (see \fI--server.address\fR).
.P
This is a string because a service alias can be used as a valid value. The
alias are commonly located at \fI/etc/services\fR. See also
\fBgetaddrinfo(3)\fR and \fBservices(5)\fR.
.P
The default port (323) is privileged. To improve security, either change or
jail it.
.P
In case you don't wish to use another port nor execute FORT validator as root,
you could use CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability (to bind to privileged ports), or
NAT/firewall port redirection.
.RE
.P

.B \-\-server.backlog=\fIUNSIGNED_INTEGER\fR
.RS 4
RTR server’s listen queue length. It’s the second argument of the function
\fIlisten\fR (see more at man \fBlisten(2)\fR). This provides a hint to the
implementation which the implementation shall use to limit the number of
outstanding connections in the socket’s listen queue.
.P
By default, it has a value of \fISOMAXCONN\fR.
.RE
.P

.B \-\-server.interval.validation=\fIUNSIGNED_INTEGER\fR
.RS 4
Number of seconds that FORT will sleep between validation cycles. The timer
starts counting every time a validation is finished, not every time it begins.
Therefore, the actual validation loop is longer than this number.
.P
By default, it has a value of \fI3600\fR.
.RE
.P

.B \-\-server.interval.refresh=\fIUNSIGNED_INTEGER\fR
.RS 4
Number of seconds that a router should wait before the next attempt to poll 
FORT using either a Serial Query PDU or Reset Query PDU. Countdown for this
timer starts upon receipt of an End Of Data PDU (this should be administered by
the client).
.P
This value is utilized only on RTR version 1 sessions (more information at RFC
8210 section 6).
.P
By default, it has a value of \fI3600\fR. Minimum allowed value: \fI1\fR,
maximum allowed value \fI86400\fR.
.RE
.P

.B \-\-server.interval.retry=\fIUNSIGNED_INTEGER\fR
.RS 4
Number of seconds that a router should wait before retrying a failed Serial
Query PDU or Reset Query PDU. Countdown for this timer starts upon failure of
the query and restarts after each subsequent failure until a query succeeds
(this should be administered by the client).
.P
This value is utilized only on RTR version 1 sessions (more information at RFC
8210 section 6).
.P
By default, it has a value of \fI600\fR. Minimum allowed value: \fI1\fR,
maximum allowed value \fI7200\fR.
.RE
.P

.B \-\-server.interval.expire=\fIUNSIGNED_INTEGER\fR
.RS 4
Number of seconds that a router can retain the current version of data while
unable to perform a successful subsequent query. Countdown for this timer starts
upon receipt of an End Of Data PDU (this should be administered by the client).
.P
This value is utilized only on RTR version 1 sessions (more information at RFC
8210 section 6).
.P
By default, it has a value of \fI7200\fR. Minimum allowed value: \fI600\fR,
maximum allowed value \fI172800\fR. It must be larger than
\fIserver.interval.refresh\fR and \fIserver.interval.retry\fR.
.RE
.P

.B \-\-server.deltas.lifetime=\fIUNSIGNED_INTEGER\fR
.RS 4
When routers first connect to Fort, they request a snapshot of the validation results. (ROAs and Router Keys.) Because they need to keep their validated objects updated, and snapshots tend to be relatively large amounts of information, they request deltas afterwards over configurable intervals. ("Deltas" being the differences between snapshots.)
.P
During each validation cycle, Fort generates a new snapshot, as well as the deltas needed to build the new snapshot from the previous one. These are all stored in RAM. \fI--server.deltas.lifetime\fR is the number of iterations a set of deltas will be kept before being deallocated. (Recall that every iteration lasts \fI--server.interval.validation\fR seconds, plus however long the validation takes.)
.P
If a router lags behind, to the point Fort has already deleted the deltas it needs to update the router’s snapshot, Fort will have to fall back to fetch the entire latest snapshot instead.
.RE
.P

.B \-\-prometheus.port=\fIUNSIGNED_INTEGER\fR

.RE
.P

.B \-\-http.priority=\fIUNSIGNED_INTEGER\fR
.RS 4
Assign priority to use HTTP to fetch repository files. A higher value means a
higher priority.
.P
This argument works along with \fB--rsync.priority\fR, since the higher value
of the two arguments will result in the first protocol to utilize when fetching
repositories files. Of course, this depends also on certificates information or
the TAL URIs, since currently HTTP URIs are optional and not every RIR
repository makes use of them.
.P
Whenever a certificate or a TAL has both RSYNC and HTTP URIs, the following
criteria is followed to prioritize which one to use first:
.RS 4
.br
\- \fI--rsync.priority\fR \fBequals\fR \fI--http.priority\fR: use the order
specified at the certificate or the TAL to fetch the corresponding URI.
.br
\- \fI--rsync.priority\fR \fBgreater than\fR \fI--http.priority\fR: use RSYNC
repository/TAL URI first; if there's an error fetching data, fallback to fetch
HTTP repository/TAL URI.
