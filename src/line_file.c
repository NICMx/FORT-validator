	 * Note to myself:

	 * getline() is very convoluted. I really don't like it. I'm actually
	 * considering getting rid of it and pulling off something that doesn't
	 * seem like it was designed by an alien, but it doesn't warrant going
	 * that far yet. Do not read its Linux man page; it didn't answer my
	 * questions. Go straight to POSIX instead.
	 *
	 * - If the file is empty, or all that's left is an empty line, it
	 *   (confusingly) returns -1. errno will be 0, feof() should return
	 *   1, ferror() should return 0.
	 * - It includes the newline in the result, which is puzzling. You will
	 *   want to remove it, BUT DON'T SWEAT IT IF IT'S NOT THERE, because
	 *   the last line of the file might not be newline-terminated.
	 * - The string WILL be NULL-terminated, but the NULL chara will not be
	 *   included in the returned length. BUT IT'S THERE. Don't worry about
	 *   writing past the allocated space on the last line.
	 * - Newline is `\n` according to POSIX, which is good, because RFC 8630
	 *   agrees. You will have to worry about `\r`, though.
	 *
	 * Also, the Linux man page claims the following:
	 *
	 *    [The out] buffer should be freed by the user program even if
	 *    getline() failed.
	 *
	 * This... does not exist in the POSIX spec. But it does make sense
	 * because getline is normally meant to be used repeatedly with a
	 * recycled buffer. (free() is a no-op if its argument is NULL so go
	 * nuts.)
	 *
	 * Update: If you remove getline(), consider downgrading _POSIX_C_SOURCE
	 * to 200112L. (And _XOPEN_SOURCE to 600.)
