/**
 * Some of the URLs defined in Access Descriptions of a certificate's
 * extensions.
 *
 * It's intended to address some awkward RFC requirements:
 * RFC 6487 defines that these "MUST reference" certain files. I think the best
 * way to validate this is to check that they equal the respective URLs from the
 * manifest (because these will at some point be validated as part of the
 * traversal anyway). Problem is, these URLs are not guaranteed to be parsed by
 * the time the extension validation kicks in. So we store them in this
 * structure and handle them later.
 *
 * It makes a mess out of the code, and I'm not even sure that validating them
 * is our responsibility, but there you go.
