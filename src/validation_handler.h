/**
 * Functions that handle validation results.
 *
 * At some point, I believe we will end up separating the validator code into a
 * library, so it can be used by other applications aside from Fort's RTR
 * server.
 *
 * This structure is designed with that in mind; it's the callback collection
 * that the library's user application will fill up, so it can do whatever it
 * wants with the validated ROAs.
 *
 * Because it's intended to be used by arbitrary applications, it needs to be
 * generic. Please refrain from adding callbacks that are specifically meant for
 * a particular use case.
 *
 * All of these functions can be NULL.
