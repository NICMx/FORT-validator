/*
 * One certificate stack is allocated per validation cycle, and it is used
 * through its entirety to hold the certificates relevant to the ongoing
 * validation.
 *
 * Keep in mind: This module deals with two different (but correlated) stack
 * data structures, and they both store "certificates" (albeit in different
 * representations):
 *
 * - Defer stack: This one stores certificates whose validation has been
 *   postponed during the validation cycle. (They were found in some manifest
 *   list, and haven't been opened yet.)
 *   It prevents us from having to validate the RPKI tree in a recursive manner,
 *   which would be prone to stack overflow.
 * - x509 stack: It is a chain of certificates, ready to be validated by
 *   libcrypto.
 *   For any given certificate being validated, this stack stores all of its
 *   parents.
