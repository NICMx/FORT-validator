## Design

Fort is an MIT-licensed RPKI Relying Party. It is a service that downloads the RPKI repositories, validates their entirety and serves the resulting ROAs for easy access by your routers.

The Validator is a timer that, [every once in a while](usage.html#--serverintervalvalidation), resynchronizes its [local cache of the RPKI Repository](usage.html#--local-repository), validates the resulting [certificate chains](intro-rpki.html) and stores the resulting valid ROAs in memory. The RTR [Server](usage.html#--serveraddress) (which is part of the same binary) delivers these ROAs to any requesting routers.

Fort is a command-line application intended for UNIX operating systems, written in C.
