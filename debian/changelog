fort (1.4.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Bug fix: Some XML parsing and validation errors where printed straight to
    stderr, now they're printed to the configured "validation-log.output".
  * Bug fix: The protocol part of an URI only was only valid in lowercase, now
    the case is ignored.

  * Update: RTR server can bind to multiple IPs.
  * Update: Deprecate all "rrdp.*" arguments, renaming them to "http.*". The new
    arguments are "http.enabled", "http.priority", "http.retry.count" and
    "http.retry.interval". They apply for each outgoing http request.
  * Update: The 4 TALs now include an HTTPs URI.
  * Update: HTTPS requests are now preferred by default over RSYNC requests,
    this applies only where both of the options are present.
  * Update: New incidences for stale manifests ("incid-mft-stale") and stale
    CRLs ("incid-crl-stale").

fort (1.3.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Bug fix: Minimize function calls and processing once a fork is made to
    execute rsync, related to github issue #35.

  * Update: Separate the validation messages from the operation messages, each
    log type has its own configuration arguments.
  * Update: Include a configurable syslog facility for each log type, useful
    when syslog is utilized.
  * Update: Add new argument 'stale-repository-period'. When a repository URI
    can't be reached, the validator will log the error messages at the
    operation log after 'stale-repository-period' seconds had elapsed since the
    first error fetching the repository URI.
  * Update: Work with local files if a repository can't be synced.

fort (1.2.1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Bug fix: Add broken pipe (SIGPIPE) signal handler, this avoids a sudden
    death when the socket is still alive at the server but closed at the client
    side.
  * Bug fix: Don't hold the DB lock when the SLURM is being loaded.
  * Bug fix: Specific for CentOS7 libcurl: check for time condition met/unmet
    (whenever the HTTP header "If-Modified-Since" is sent) when requesting RRDP
    update notification files.
  * Bug fix: Stop sending PDUs on reset exchange error.
  * Bug fix: Fix GCC 10 compiling error and warnings (solves github issue #32).

  * Update: Add capability 'CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE' to this package in order to
    bind the RTR server to port 323 by default.
  * Update: Wait for client connections at '--server.port' until the first
    validation cycle is done.
  * Update: Update internal PDU logs.
  * Update: SLURM upgrades:
    -Improve loading process, use an internal cache when a SLURM file is being
     loaded.
    -Don't discard the loaded SLURM if there's an error applying it.
    -Calculate SLURM file(s) checksum and compare it with its previous one to
     avoid loading each SLURM at every validation cycle if there aren't
     updates.
    -Stop doing unnecessary validations, since they aren't part of the
     RFC 8416: duplicated elements at the same file, covered prefixes at the
     same file.
  * Update: Add new incidences related to manifests processing (solves github
    issue #28)
  * Update: Internal improvements resultant from a code review.

fort (1.2.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Bug fix: Solve github issue #9 "Use previous valid SLURM configuration on
    SLURM error": whenever there's an error processing the SLURM, apply the last
    valid SLURM version.
  * Bug fix: If an empty value was sent to arguments that expect paths
    (eg. 'fort --tal='), this was treated as valid; now this isn't allowed.

  * Bug fix: Allow reuse server address/port on restart.
  * Bug fix: Try to fetch the trust anchor certificate from another URI whenever
    the previous TAL URI wasn't fetched due to an error.

     valid Prefixes and Router Keys, current/new serial number, and real
     execution time).
  * Update: Add setup script to ease ARINs TAL download, explicitly accepting
    their RPA. The script does the following:

    -'rsync.priority': Priority to use this protocol whenever a CA has another
      option to access the repository files.
    -'rsync.strategy': Synchronization download strategy (replaces
      'sync-strategy').
    -'rsync.retry.count': Maximum number of retries whenever there's an
      execution error.
    .'rsync.retry.interval': Interval (in seconds) between each retry.
    -'asn1-decode-max-stack': indicates the max stack size that can be utilized
      when decoding ASN1 objects (mainly to avoid a stack overflow).

    the server address.
